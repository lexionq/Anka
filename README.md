# Anka Browser v2.0
> [!NOTE]
> Before that I had developed a version using PyQt, but the project was canceled due to Python's stupid(!) shortcomings. Now Anka Browser is with you in a more powerful and better version developed with C++. Since it is the second version I made with C++, there are some shortcomings compared to the versions developed with Python. But don't doubt that these will be fixed in the near future.
