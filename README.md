# Anka Browser v1.0
> [!NOTE]
> Before that I had developed a version using PyQt, but the project was canceled due to Python's stupid(!) shortcomings. Now Anka Browser is with you in a more powerful and better version developed with C++. Since it is the first version I made with C++, there are some shortcomings compared to the versions developed with Python. But don't doubt that these will be fixed in the near future.

## What features does this version include? 🔮
- Customizable Tabs
- Changable Search Engine
- Show Your Browser History and Downloads History
- Delete Your Browser History

Hey curious, this README is not very detailed as it was just written. I'll be sure to update it for you personally as soon as I can (hopefully.)!
